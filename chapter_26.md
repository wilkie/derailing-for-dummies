It can happen: you may reach the point where, in spite of expertly using all of these tactics, you’re suddenly struck by the discomforting notion that maybe the Marginalised People™, uh, *have a point*.

This doesn’t feel very good for any Privileged Person®. It’s highly uncomfortable for a start-off, the sensation *you may be wrong about something*. But even worse, it may mean you have to endure the humiliation of *admitting that*!!

But never fear, for all is not lost! You can still worm your way out of this one!

Simply say:

***“It was all a social experiment!”***

This makes it okay, you see! Not only does it imply to the Marginalised People™ you’re really not the ignorant, obnoxious bigot you might be beginning to realise you are, you successfully communicate to them that you are *that* insensitive, *that* arrogant and *that* much of a douchebag you would take very real and serious issues that affect their lives and treat them as nothing more than a theoretical discussion for your own detached amusement!

In this way you cover your arse whilst affirming your privilege!
