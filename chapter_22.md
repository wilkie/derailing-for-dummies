title: "You're Not Being A Team Player"

Shifting blame is very important in these matters. You don’t ever want to have to own up to any responsibility for hurt or distress caused and you most definitely do not want to admit your prejudice or bigotry. You also want that Marginalised Person™ to be continuously aware just how “on the fringes” they are, and always will be (providing you get your way – but that’s what Privilege® is for, after all!).

You can achieve both these things by accusing the Marginalised Person™ of not playing fair, or of not playing with “the team” (i.e.: you and all the other Privileged People® backing you up).

“C’mon”, you say, “we’re all doing our best to participate in a reasonable, impartial debate. You aren’t joining in. You’re trying to turn this into a fight. You’re ruining it for everyone else!”

In other words: *if you just did and said exactly everything we Privileged People® demand of you, life would be so much easier. For me. For you, well,  what gave you the impression I care about you?*

This tactic subtly combines several of the above points: [You’re Taking Things Too Personally](#), [You’re Arguing With Opinions, Not Fact](#) and [You Have A False Consciousness](#), and really makes the Marginalised Person™ feel ganged up on.

It’s great to gang-up on someone, particularly someone who faces such othering every day of their lives. It reinforces their sense of isolation, which will distress and disorient them, weakening their stance.

Deliver it in just the right condescending tone too, and you will really unhinge them…
