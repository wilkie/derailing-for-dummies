title: "But You're Different To The Others"
---

Backhanded insults are a fantastic way to trip up and flummox a Marginalised Person™. This step is often used when you’ve said something discriminatory either forgetting or being oblivious to the fact a person from the Marginalised Group™ you’re targeting is right there and has seen/heard it.

They will be offended of course, and that’s when you try to mollify them by reassuring them that they’re “different” to the others.

“Oh, you’re not like all those *other* bitchy women” perhaps, or maybe: “Yes, but you’re an *attractive* fat man!”

Other suggestions include: “I wasn’t talking about you when I was saying most trans women are ugly. You pass pretty well!”; “Yes, but you’re not like those other black people who won’t better themselves, you’re very educated!”. Maybe even: “It’s so good that you stay away from drugs, unlike those other sex workers”.

Perhaps even: “Sure, but most mentally ill people are very selfish and self-obsessed. You’re a really *nice* person!”

Not only do you get to reinforce commonly held stereotypes about various Marginalised Groups™ revealing that you truly believe them, you get to deliver a double-edged compliment to the Marginalised Person™ involved.  By using this tactic you’re hoping to play on their emotions, connect with their usual experience of being Marginalised™ for being “other” and turn it around by now “flattering” them for it and how they are differentiated from the “others” because they’re “special” and (almost) worthy of a place in the ranks of the Privileged® (almost) because they are better at conforming to standards set by the Privileged®.

So deeply ingrained can many insulting preconceptions of their Marginalised Group™ be that they may be torturously flattered – we all like to feel the sun on our faces after all! And so, in this way, you also get to reinforce the internalised stigma they may carry.

Finally, you will invoke rage on behalf of their fellows whom you have sweepingly and summarily dismissed and degraded. A conflicting swirl of emotions is very useful to work with!

And finally, of course, you once again imply it is your right as a Privileged Person® to pass judgement or cast approval of them.

However be warned if you’re using this tactic to try and halt the conversation before it goes any further: the Marginalised Person™ may very well be further provoked into confronting you with your ignorance. Use it with caution.
