title: "Unless You Can Prove Your Experience Is Widespread I Won't Believe It"
---

You’ve successfully got them in a catch-22: we’ve already established experience is not a monolith and just because people come from the same Marginalised Group™ does not mean they will all have the same thoughts and feelings and experiences.

Yet with this one you can make it an essential proviso of your agreement that they have to PROVE what they’re claiming is definitively representative of a majority of their group of people.

What is really awesome is that if, by this point, you have them so upset and frustrated that they are not carefully disclaiming their language and so say something that you can in any way distort to mean that they‘re speaking “on behalf“ of all people from their group, you can go right back up to the prior point, [Your Experience Is Not Representative of Everyone](#your-experience-is-not-representative-of-everyone), and start all over again. You can repeat these two as many times as you like! In fact, this is highly recommended as it will increase feelings of anger and frustration on their part, and then you can throw [You’re Taking Things Too Personally](#youre-taking-things-too-personally) or [You’re Getting Hostile](#youre-being-hostile) at them!
