    <p>You know how it is. You’re enjoy&shy;ing your&shy;self, kick&shy;ing back and relax&shy;ing at the pub or maybe at the library; or maybe you’re in class or just casu&shy;ally surf&shy;ing the inter&shy;net, indulging in a lit&shy;tle con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion. The topic of the con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion is about a per&shy;ti&shy;nent con&shy;tem&shy;po&shy;rary issue, prob&shy;a&shy;bly some&shy;thing to do with a group of peo&shy;ple who fall out&shy;side your realm of expe&shy;ri&shy;ence and iden&shy;ti&shy;ty. They’re also prob&shy;a&shy;bly fairly heav&shy;ily dis&shy;crim&shy;i&shy;nated against – or so they claim. The thing is, you’re hav&shy;ing a good time, shar&shy;ing your knowl&shy;edge about these peo&shy;ple and their issues. This knowl&shy;edge is incon&shy;tro&shy;vert&shy;ible – it’s been backed up in media rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tion, books, research and lots and lots of his&shy;tor&shy;i&shy;cal events, also your own unas&shy;sail&shy;able sense of being right.</p>
    
    <p>Yet all of a sud&shy;den some&shy;thing hap&shy;pens to put a damp&shy;ener on your shar&shy;ing of your envi&shy;able intel&shy;lect and incom&shy;pa&shy;ra&shy;ble capac&shy;ity to fully per&shy;ceive and under&shy;stand All Things. It’s some&shy;one who belongs to the group of peo&shy;ple you’re dis&shy;cussing and they’re Not Very Happy with you. Appar&shy;ent&shy;ly, they claim, you’ve got it all wrong and they’re offended about that. They might be a per&shy;son of colour, or a queer per&shy;son. Maybe they’re a wom&shy;an, or a per&shy;son with dis&shy;abil&shy;i&shy;ty. They could even be a trans per&shy;son or a sex work&shy;er. The point is they’re try&shy;ing to tell you they know bet&shy;ter than you about their issues and you know that’s just plain wrong. How could you be wrong?</p>
    
    <p>Don’t worry though! There IS some&shy;thing you can do to nip this poten&shy;tially awk&shy;ward and embar&shy;rass&shy;ing sit&shy;u&shy;a&shy;tion in the bud. By sim&shy;ply derail&shy;ing the con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion, dis&shy;miss&shy;ing their opin&shy;ion as false and ridi&shy;cul&shy;ing their expe&shy;ri&shy;ence you can be sure that they con&shy;tinue to be mar&shy;ginalised and unheard and you can con&shy;tinue to look like the expert you know you really are, deep down inside!</p>
    
    <p><strong>CON&shy;GRAT&shy;U&shy;LA&shy;TIONS, YOU HAVE PRIV&shy;I&shy;LEGE!</strong></p>
    
    <p>Just fol&shy;low this step-by-step guide to Con&shy;vers&shy;ing with Mar&shy;ginalised Peo&shy;ple™ and in no time at all you will have a fool-proof method of derail&shy;ing every chal&shy;leng&shy;ing con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion you may get into, thus reap&shy;ing the full ben&shy;e&shy;fits of every priv&shy;i&shy;lege that you have.</p>
    
    <p>The best part is, you don’t even have to be a white, het&shy;ero&shy;sex&shy;u&shy;al, cis&shy;gen&shy;dered, cis&shy;sex&shy;u&shy;al, upper-&shy;class male to enjoy the full ben&shy;e&shy;fits of derail&shy;ing con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion! Nope, you can utilise the lesser-recog&shy;nised tac&shy;tic of Hor&shy;i&shy;zon&shy;tal Hos&shy;til&shy;ity to make sure that, despite being a mem&shy;ber of a Mar&shy;ginalised Group™ your&shy;self, you can exer&shy;cise a priv&shy;i&shy;lege another Mar&shy;ginalised Group™ does&shy;n’t have in order not to heed their expe&shy;ri&shy;ence!</p>
    
    <p>Read on, and learn, and remem&shy;ber… you don’t have to use these in any par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar order! In fact, mix&shy;ing them up can really keep those Mar&shy;ginalised Peo&shy;ple™ on their toes! After all, they are pretty much used to hear&shy;ing this stuff, so you don’t want to get too pre&shy;dictable or they’ll get lazy!</p>

    <h1 id='if-you-wont-educate-me-how-can-i-learn'>If You Won't Educate Me How Can I Learn</h1><p>Whilst seem&shy;ingly sim&shy;ple on the sur&shy;face, there is some inter&shy;twin&shy;ing sub&shy;text embed&shy;ded within this one.</p>
    
    <p>First of all, you’re plac&shy;ing respon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;ity for your edu&shy;ca&shy;tion back onto the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™. As they are obvi&shy;ously engaged with these issues, and care about them, they are hope&shy;ful that Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Peo&shy;ple® may one day start lis&shy;ten&shy;ing and tak&shy;ing onboard what they have to say. By plac&shy;ing respon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;ity to edu&shy;cate in their hands, you tug at this yearn&shy;ing. You may even suc&shy;cess&shy;fully make many ques&shy;tion them&shy;selves and their self&shy;ish expec&shy;ta&shy;tions that you utilise the hun&shy;dreds upon hun&shy;dreds of resources on the sub&shy;ject avail&shy;able to you as a Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Per&shy;son®! After all, any&shy;one who expects you to be able to research a topic by your&shy;self also clearly expects you to be far more of a func&shy;tion&shy;ing adult than you’re act&shy;ing!</p>
    
    <p>By insist&shy;ing you can only learn if they right then and there sac&shy;ri&shy;fice fur&shy;ther hours of time going over the same ground they have so often in the past, you may also make them give up and go away alto&shy;geth&shy;er, enabling you to win by default.</p>
    
    <p>But fur&shy;ther, you give the impres&shy;sion that you really want to learn, but they’re hold&shy;ing you back! That’s right, using this tac&shy;tic you can sug&shy;gest that full under&shy;stand&shy;ing is what you crave – you want to be a bet&shy;ter, more con&shy;nected and com&shy;pas&shy;sion&shy;ate per&shy;son – but it’s not your fault! Nobody ever gave you the edu&shy;ca&shy;tion! And now that some&shy;one is here who is so obvi&shy;ously qual&shy;i&shy;fied, they’re deny&shy;ing you your Priv&shy;i&shy;lege® given right to have every&shy;thing you want handed to you on a plat&shy;ter!</p>
    
    <p>Which brings us to another key com&shy;po&shy;nent of this argu&shy;ment – it is very impor&shy;tant, in con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tions with Mar&shy;ginalised Peo&shy;ple™, to con&shy;stantly remind them that you are, indeed, Priv&shy;i&shy;leged®. By demon&shy;strat&shy;ing your belief that Mar&shy;ginalised Peo&shy;ple™ should imme&shy;di&shy;ately grat&shy;ify your every whim, you remind them of their place in soci&shy;ety. After all, they’re not there to live lives free of dis&shy;crim&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion and in hap&shy;py, inde&shy;pen&shy;dent and ful&shy;fill&shy;ing ways! Please! Mar&shy;ginalised Peo&shy;ple™ exist for your curios&shy;ity and to make you gen&shy;er&shy;ally feel bet&shy;ter about your place in soci&shy;ety and don’t let them for&shy;get it!</p>
    
    <p><strong>Point one to you!</strong></p>
    <h1 id='if-you-cared-about-these-matters-youd-be-willing-to-educate-me'>If You Cared About These Matters You'd Be Willing To Educate Me</h1><p>This is the nat&shy;ural fol&shy;low-up to the above argu&shy;ment, although it can also be used inde&shy;pen&shy;dent&shy;ly.</p>
    
    <p>You see, often in these dis&shy;cus&shy;sions a Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ will tell you it’s not their respon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;ity to edu&shy;cate you. This is because Mar&shy;ginalised Peo&shy;ple™ believe that they have other pri&shy;or&shy;i&shy;ties in life, like work&shy;ing and study&shy;ing and being with their fam&shy;i&shy;lies for exam&shy;ple.</p>
    
    <p>Clear&shy;ly, they are labour&shy;ing under a mis&shy;per&shy;cep&shy;tion – as a Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Per&shy;son® you have far more right to their time than they do, and besides, don’t they want to make the world a bet&shy;ter place? Isn’t that why they alerted you to the fact you were being offen&shy;sive in the first place? Well, now clearly your edu&shy;ca&shy;tion is their respon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty!</p>
    
    <p>By plac&shy;ing this bur&shy;den of respon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;ity onto them you remind them of just how daunt&shy;ing a task that is and how their lives are con&shy;stantly being monop&shy;o&shy;lised by the Priv&shy;i&shy;leged®, even in some&shy;thing that should be empow&shy;er&shy;ing to them, like decon&shy;struct&shy;ing dis&shy;crim&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion.</p>
    
    <p>You triv&shy;i&shy;alise their lives, needs, inter&shy;ests and oblig&shy;a&shy;tions by sug&shy;gest&shy;ing they should be spend&shy;ing all of their time and energy in engag&shy;ing with clue&shy;less Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Peo&shy;ple®, putting in hours and hours of effort in repeat&shy;ing the exact same thing they’ve already said three thou&shy;sand times to three thou&shy;sand other Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Peo&shy;ple® in their past.</p>
    
    <p>And fur&shy;ther&shy;more, you remind them that, if they really cared about their own issues, they’d will&shy;ingly take that task on! Surely it’s a small price to pay to change peo&shy;ple‘s minds?</p>
    
    <p>Well, you want them to think that, but of course it isn’t. After all, most of the con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tions they have with Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Peo&shy;ple® often feel to them like beat&shy;ing their heads repeat&shy;edly against a brick wall embed&shy;ded with rusty spikes.</p>
    
    <p>Which is entirely the point. Keep them worn out and exhausted and maybe they’ll just go away.</p>
    <h1 id='youre-being-hostile'>You're Being Hostile</h1><p>This is a great one to pop out if it seems like they’re going to push the mat&shy;ter. After all, nobody wants to be “hos&shy;tile”, do they? In a cul&shy;ture rigidly defined by social pro&shy;to&shy;col, invari&shy;ably designed to favour the priv&shy;i&shy;leged, peo&shy;ple are very con&shy;cerned about “get&shy;ting along with oth&shy;er&shy;s“.</p>
    
    <p>Espe&shy;cially Mar&shy;ginalised Peo&shy;ple™! Know why? Well, since they’re mar&shy;ginalised, they expe&shy;ri&shy;ence a vari&shy;ety of dis&shy;crim&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tions, usu&shy;ally in many aspects of their daily lives. It is not at all unusu&shy;al, there&shy;fore, for Mar&shy;ginalised Peo&shy;ple™ to have to be accus&shy;tomed to being very, very cau&shy;tious about the way they engage with the Priv&shy;i&shy;leged®. This is because dis&shy;crim&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion may mean they rou&shy;tinely encounter vio&shy;lence, silenc&shy;ing, oppres&shy;sion or just good old-&shy;fash&shy;ioned out&shy;right ridicule and dimin&shy;ish&shy;ment. That can make life stress&shy;ful and exhaust&shy;ing, so many Mar&shy;ginalised Peo&shy;ple™ develop com&shy;plex strate&shy;gies to avoid hos&shy;tile engage&shy;ments with Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Peo&shy;ple®.</p>
    
    <p>Fur&shy;ther to this, Mar&shy;ginalised Peo&shy;ple™ are forced into a cer&shy;tain sort of social behav&shy;iour by Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Peo&shy;ple® – “ap&shy;pro&shy;pri&shy;ate” behav&shy;iour. After all, there are dif&shy;fer&shy;ent rules for them than there are for the Priv&shy;i&shy;leged®. This train&shy;ing in “ap&shy;pro&shy;pri&shy;ate” behav&shy;iour usu&shy;ally begins when they are very young, so it is well-in&shy;grained.</p>
    
    <p>By accus&shy;ing them of hos&shy;til&shy;i&shy;ty, you will suc&shy;cess&shy;fully enliven their sense of cau&shy;tion and anx&shy;i&shy;ety around this mat&shy;ter. You may also pro&shy;voke a feel&shy;ing of guilt that they are not “be&shy;hav&shy;ing” the way they have been trained to.</p>
    
    <p>But even bet&shy;ter – by accus&shy;ing them of hos&shy;til&shy;i&shy;ty, you pass the blame back to them, rather than con&shy;sider what you might have said that was so offen&shy;sive and hurt&shy;ful it caused the “hos&shy;til&shy;i&shy;ty”!</p>
    
    <p>This will def&shy;i&shy;nitely work in your favour, because it will fur&shy;ther insult and enrage them. You are mak&shy;ing pro&shy;gress…</p>
    <h1 id='but-that-happens-to-me-too'>But That Happens To Me Too!</h1><p>In attempt&shy;ing to com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;cate with you, the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ may bring up exam&shy;ples of the sorts of daily man&shy;i&shy;fes&shy;ta&shy;tions of dis&shy;crim&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion they face. Many of these exam&shy;ples seem triv&shy;ial to Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Peo&shy;ple® but clearly reflect the way the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ has been “othered” by soci&shy;ety. “Other&shy;ing” is a sys&shy;tem of social mark&shy;ers that defines “Us” and “them”, neatly and con&shy;ve&shy;niently cat&shy;e&shy;goris&shy;ing peo&shy;ple into their appro&shy;pri&shy;ate places within soci&shy;ety. It’s a way of defin&shy;ing a secured and pos&shy;i&shy;tive posi&shy;tion in the world by stig&shy;ma&shy;tis&shy;ing “other&shy;s”. In other words, it’s the process of dehu&shy;man&shy;is&shy;ing any&shy;one dif&shy;fer&shy;ent to the Cho&shy;sen Priv&shy;i&shy;leged.</p>
    
    <p>The Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ you’re deal&shy;ing with has been sub&shy;jected to this “other&shy;ing”.</p>
    
    <p>This means that their body is viewed as pub&shy;lic prop&shy;erty and the per&shy;son&shy;al, intri&shy;cate details of their lives and being are per&shy;ceived as free infor&shy;ma&shy;tion.</p>
    
    <p>You must nod patiently as the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ tries to gain your under&shy;stand&shy;ing of the many com&shy;pli&shy;cated and sub&shy;tle ways this oth&shy;er&shy;ing impacts their lives until they come across a point that seems par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;larly grat&shy;ing for them. Then you must say “oh, but I expe&shy;ri&shy;ence that too!”</p>
    
    <p>For exam&shy;ple, peo&shy;ple of African descent often express out&shy;rage and irri&shy;ta&shy;tion at the fact many white peo&shy;ple believe they can freely touch their hair. This inva&shy;sion of their per&shy;sonal space is dressed up as flat&shy;tery – “oh, what beau&shy;ti&shy;ful hair you have!” and per&shy;mis&shy;sion is not sought or granted before the action is tak&shy;en. “That hap&shy;pens to every&shy;one!” you must exclaim. “My child has beau&shy;ti&shy;ful white-blonde hair and peo&shy;ple are always touch&shy;ing it!”</p>
    
    <p>Sex work&shy;ers, as another exam&shy;ple, often endure highly inti&shy;mate ques&shy;tions regard&shy;ing all aspects of their lives, sex&shy;ual habits and client inter&shy;ac&shy;tions. When they gripe about how inva&shy;sive this is, you must equate it to your own work: “Oh, I know, I’m a lawyer and peo&shy;ple always want to know what goes on in court!” “To&shy;tal&shy;ly, I’m a doc&shy;tor and peo&shy;ple are always ask&shy;ing about gross con&shy;di&shy;tions I see!”</p>
    
    <p>With a trans per&shy;son, many peo&shy;ple expect all the details of the tran&shy;si&shy;tion process should be made avail&shy;able to them, includ&shy;ing details of how they “trans&shy;for&shy;m“. When they talk about how frus&shy;trat&shy;ing this is, you must com&shy;mis&shy;er&shy;ate: “Yeah, don’t you hate the way men always want you to explain the mys&shy;ter&shy;ies of make-up and skin care!” you should blithely exclaim.</p>
    
    <p>If you are speak&shy;ing to a fat per&shy;son who is com&shy;plain&shy;ing about the lack of fash&shy;ion-&shy;for&shy;ward and beau&shy;ti&shy;ful cloth&shy;ing made in their size, try some&shy;thing like: “The fash&shy;ion indus&shy;try sucks! They just do not make clothes for real bod&shy;ies – I mean, just because I am a size four does&shy;n’t mean I’m short! Jeans are always too short on me!”</p>
    
    <p>With&shy;out a doubt, one of the most pow&shy;er&shy;ful tac&shy;tics to use here is com&shy;par&shy;ing male cir&shy;cum&shy;ci&shy;sion to female gen&shy;i&shy;tal muti&shy;la&shy;tion. In any dis&shy;cus&shy;sion around FGM, make sure you quickly leap in and say: “But why is it ok for lit&shy;tle boys to be muti&shy;lat&shy;ed? Why isn’t any&shy;one talk&shy;ing about that?” Because the removal of a tiny flap of skin is entirely com&shy;pa&shy;ra&shy;ble to the crip&shy;pling muti&shy;la&shy;tion many young girls are sub&shy;jected to.</p>
    
    <p>What this demon&shy;strates is your total lack of under&shy;stand&shy;ing of what “other&shy;ing” means in a prac&shy;ti&shy;cal sense. You’re ignor&shy;ing the way your life is oth&shy;er&shy;wise entirely immersed in a state of absolute priv&shy;i&shy;lege and reveal&shy;ing the fact you fail to com&shy;pre&shy;hend the process of objec&shy;ti&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tion and mar&shy;ginal&shy;is&shy;ing they go through all the time. When you are Priv&shy;i&shy;leged®, “sim&shy;i&shy;lar” expe&shy;ri&shy;ences sim&shy;ply do not hap&shy;pen on an equal foot&shy;ing because they do not oth&shy;er&shy;wise reflect mar&shy;ginal&shy;i&shy;sa&shy;tion. This obliv&shy;i&shy;ous&shy;ness is highly insen&shy;si&shy;tive and triv&shy;i&shy;al&shy;is&shy;ing and will def&shy;i&shy;nitely cause them to grind their teeth!</p>
    
    <p>But it’s also an impor&shy;tant step in affirm&shy;ing your priv&shy;i&shy;lege: Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Peo&shy;ple® are accus&shy;tomed, after all, to it being “all about them”. Not used to sim&shy;ply sit&shy;ting back and lis&shy;ten&shy;ing to oth&shy;ered peo&shy;ple‘s issues, Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Peo&shy;ple® like to be the cen&shy;tre of atten&shy;tion at all times. It reminds them that they are impor&shy;tant. By doing this, you will feel good about your&shy;self and send a cru&shy;cial mes&shy;sage to the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ (yes you really can dimin&shy;ish their expe&shy;ri&shy;ence by mak&shy;ing it all about you, all the time!).</p>
    <h1 id='youre-being-overemotional'>You're Being Overemotional</h1><p>It is very likely that the whole rea&shy;son the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ in ques&shy;tion is debat&shy;ing with you is because they’ve made a con&shy;scious deci&shy;sion to speak out about these issues, despite the pain and heartache it can often cause them.</p>
    
    <p>There&shy;fore, the “you’re being hos&shy;tile” bomb can often lead to an increase of anger and/or hurt. Some&shy;times it just leads to greater empha&shy;sis and exas&shy;per&shy;a&shy;tion in the argu&shy;ment.</p>
    
    <p>It really does&shy;n’t mat&shy;ter, because you can still use it against them by accus&shy;ing them of being over&shy;e&shy;mo&shy;tion&shy;al. You may wish to use the word “hys&shy;ter&shy;i&shy;cal” instead. “Hys&shy;ter&shy;i&shy;cal” is also a word laden with neg&shy;a&shy;tive con&shy;no&shy;ta&shy;tions, so it’s par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;larly effec&shy;tive. Using this one in dis&shy;cus&shy;sions with women is highly advis&shy;able, as the opin&shy;ions and feel&shy;ings of women have his&shy;tor&shy;i&shy;cally been denied as mere “hys&shy;te&shy;ri&shy;a”, but it works against almost any&shy;one. A great one to use with women as well is to ask them if they’re “PM&shy;S&shy;ing”. Yes, it’s an oldie but a clas&shy;sic.</p>
    
    <p>If you need more vari&shy;ety, some more handy argu&shy;ment win&shy;ners involv&shy;ing spec&shy;u&shy;lat&shy;ing as to peo&shy;ple’s neu&shy;rotyp&shy;i&shy;cal sta&shy;tus: ask them if they’re “neu&shy;rotic” or “schizo” for exam&shy;ple. Imply&shy;ing peo&shy;ple have men&shy;tal health issues is a great way to dis&shy;miss their con&shy;cerns; it’s also insen&shy;si&shy;tive to peo&shy;ple with actual men&shy;tal health issues!</p>
    
    <p>After all, proper “in&shy;tel&shy;lec&shy;tu&shy;al” dis&shy;cus&shy;sions always involve detach&shy;ment and ratio&shy;nal&shy;i&shy;ty. What is “ra&shy;tional&shy;i&shy;ty”? It’s a way of approach&shy;ing emo&shy;tional mat&shy;ters devoid of sen&shy;ti&shy;ment, par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;larly prized by Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Peo&shy;ple® as it enables a con&shy;tin&shy;u&shy;ing inequity of power that favours them: after all, if they aren’t emo&shy;tion&shy;ally attached to the topic by way of Lived Expe&shy;ri&shy;ence©, it is eas&shy;ier for them to be “ra&shy;tional”.</p>
    <h1 id='youre-just-oversensitive'>You're Just Oversensitive</h1><p>Once again, though very sim&shy;i&shy;lar to You’re Being Over&shy;e&shy;mo&shy;tion&shy;al, this one has a slightly dif&shy;fer&shy;ent nuance.</p>
    
    <p>What you’re imply&shy;ing is that the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ is look&shy;ing for offence where none exists.</p>
    
    <p>Once again, you’re dis&shy;own&shy;ing your own respon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty, and this is absolutely the crux of any derail&shy;ment – you just can’t repeat or rein&shy;force it often enough. No mat&shy;ter what, none of this is your fault – noth&shy;ing you said that was hurt&shy;ful, offen&shy;sive, big&shy;oted or dis&shy;crim&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tory is really to blame here, because you said it in all inno&shy;cence! After all, what rea&shy;son have you ever had to exam&shy;ine your ingrained prej&shy;u&shy;dices? Why should you start now?</p>
    
    <p>So you want the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ to know this is how you feel and that you really believe the respon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;ity is all theirs – if they weren’t look&shy;ing so hard for offence, every&shy;thing would be a lot more pleas&shy;ant!</p>
    
    <p>(For you)</p>
    <h1 id='you-just-enjoy-being-offended'>You Just Enjoy Being Offended</h1><p>Closely related to the above point, it’s another crit&shy;i&shy;cal ele&shy;ment of a suc&shy;cess&shy;ful der&shy;al&shy;ing. You really need to make sure the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son knows you con&shy;sider their issues to be com&shy;pletely triv&shy;ial. It’s insen&shy;si&shy;tive in the extreme – it also exem&shy;pli&shy;fies your lack of aware&shy;ness and empa&shy;thy.</p>
    
    <p>By demon&shy;strat&shy;ing you have absolutely no con&shy;cept of what a par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar issue or point may mean to them both within their con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion with you and beyond it, you get to show off just how cocooned and pro&shy;tected in Priv&shy;i&shy;lege® you really are. Remem&shy;ber how mad&shy;den&shy;ing this is for a Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ – it’s a Priv&shy;i&shy;lege® they do not share and will prob&shy;a&shy;bly never know so to wit&shy;ness it being so blithely owned and used to dimin&shy;ish their expe&shy;ri&shy;ence is bound to get their blood pump&shy;ing.</p>
    
    <p>But absolutely best of all, you are being obnox&shy;ious and hurt&shy;ful enough to tell them out&shy;right that they enjoy fac&shy;ing dis&shy;crim&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion and pre&shy;j&shy;duice. Enjoy it so much, in fact, that they “look” for rea&shy;sons to be hurt and offend&shy;ed! Wow. This one is almost breath&shy;tak&shy;ingly per&shy;fect as a derail&shy;ment tac&shy;tic, it lacks any sort of con&shy;ceiv&shy;able class and humil&shy;ity and goes straight to smug vicious&shy;ness. The very idea that any&shy;one enjoys being hurt and dis&shy;crim&shy;i&shy;nated against as a daily prac&shy;tice is so pre&shy;pos&shy;ter&shy;ous it could only be believed by a Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Per&shy;son® who’s never really expe&shy;ri&shy;enced or known what it’s like.</p>
    
    <p>The fact is, many Mar&shy;ginalised Peo&shy;ple™ go out of their way to avoid these sorts of debates and con&shy;fronta&shy;tions because it’s such a painful and unen&shy;joy&shy;able expe&shy;ri&shy;ence. Those you are encoun&shy;ter&shy;ing in this cir&shy;cum&shy;stance have likely made a con&shy;scious choice to do so, even know&shy;ing it will prob&shy;a&shy;bly go bad. For you to spit in the face of their choice in putting them&shy;selves on the line by sug&shy;gest&shy;ing it’s all fun and games for them just adds a par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;larly piquant insult to injury.</p>
    <h1 id='dont-you-have-more-important-issues-to-think-about'>Don't You Have More Important Issues To Think About</h1><p>When you’re begin&shy;ning to feel backed into a cor&shy;ner, you could do worse than to trot this one out.</p>
    
    <p>As with the best of all these tech&shy;niques, this step oper&shy;ates on sev&shy;eral lev&shy;els. First of all, it com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;cates to the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ that you think the entire debate is triv&shy;ial and below con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tion, indi&shy;cat&shy;ing you entirely dis&shy;re&shy;gard their feel&shy;ings and emo&shy;tions. Sec&shy;ond&shy;ly, you dis&shy;own respon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;ity for your part in the debate and any&shy;thing that you’ve said that may have been dis&shy;crim&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tory or offen&shy;sive.</p>
    
    <p>Final&shy;ly, you rein&shy;force your Priv&shy;i&shy;lege® by sug&shy;gest&shy;ing that it is Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Peo&shy;ple’s® job to set the agenda for the Mar&shy;ginalised Group™. After all, how could they pos&shy;si&shy;bly know what issues they should pri&shy;ori&shy;tise for them&shy;selves, they’re far too infe&shy;rior and stupid! You, with your objec&shy;tive, rac&shy;tional Priv&shy;i&shy;leged® per&shy;spec&shy;tive, on the other hand, know exactly what is most impor&shy;tant and it is def&shy;i&shy;nitely not con&shy;fronting you with your own big&shy;otry and igno&shy;rance!</p>
    <h1 id='youre-taking-things-too-personally'>You're Taking Things Too Personally</h1><p>Sim&shy;i&shy;lar to You’re Being Over&shy;e&shy;mo&shy;tional and yet with par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar uses of its own.</p>
    
    <p>You see, when you say “you’re tak&shy;ing things too per&shy;son&shy;al&shy;ly” you demon&shy;strate your igno&shy;rance that these issues ARE per&shy;sonal for them!</p>
    
    <p>That’s highly insult&shy;ing and is sure to rub any&shy;one up the wrong way. That you’re already refus&shy;ing to con&shy;sider their real&shy;ity is giv&shy;ing them a pretty good indi&shy;ca&shy;tion of how the con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion is going to degress, yet the nat&shy;ural human need for under&shy;stand&shy;ing will prob&shy;a&shy;bly com&shy;pel them to try and rea&shy;son with you, or at least to point you in the direc&shy;tion of some edu&shy;ca&shy;tional resources that will help you gain insight into their expe&shy;ri&shy;ences. This can enable you to once again make a demand for them to per&shy;son&shy;ally edu&shy;cate you instead.</p>
    
    <p>By deny&shy;ing the con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion is per&shy;sonal for them, you also reveal your own detach&shy;ment: there’s really noth&shy;ing at stake for you in get&shy;ting into this argu&shy;ment, you’re just doing it for kicks. They will be all too aware of this, and it will begin to work on their emo&shy;tions, prepar&shy;ing them nicely for the next steps you will take them through.</p>
    <h1 id='youre-not-being-intellectual-enough-youre-being-overly-intellectual'>You're Not Being Intellectual Enough / You're Being Overly Intellectual</h1><p>These two steps are always best exer&shy;cised when mar&shy;ried togeth&shy;er. They can def&shy;i&shy;nitely be used indi&shy;vid&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly, but you will fur&shy;ther dis&shy;may and infu&shy;ri&shy;ate the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ in ques&shy;tion if you use them togeth&shy;er.</p>
    
    <p>The key here is main&shy;tain&shy;ing a care&shy;ful blend of dis&shy;dain and dis&shy;missal no mat&shy;ter what the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ throws at you.</p>
    
    <p>It is impor&shy;tant, as a Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Per&shy;son®, to con&shy;stantly hedge Mar&shy;ginalised Peo&shy;ple™ accord&shy;ing to both your class and your expec&shy;ta&shy;tions of them.</p>
    
    <p>Even though the con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion tak&shy;ing place is reflec&shy;tive of or about real life cir&shy;cum&shy;stances and sit&shy;u&shy;a&shy;tions for human beings, you must be care&shy;ful to first insist on plac&shy;ing it within an aca&shy;d&shy;emic frame&shy;work. If the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ involved is speak&shy;ing in ver&shy;nac&shy;u&shy;lar and plac&shy;ing too much empha&shy;sis on Lived Expe&shy;ri&shy;ence©, you must swiftly impress that you can&shy;not con&shy;sider it a proper “de&shy;bate” unless the&shy;ory and phi&shy;los&shy;o&shy;phy play a key com&shy;po&shy;nent, com&shy;plete with big words nor&shy;mally not found out&shy;side of aca&shy;d&shy;emic papers. This is another way of press&shy;ing home your own priv&shy;i&shy;lege by demand&shy;ing the con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion take place on terms the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ may not be inti&shy;mate with. After all, acad&shy;emia has lit&shy;tle to do with real&shy;i&shy;ty, but pre&shy;tend&shy;ing that it does is sure to under&shy;mine your oppo&shy;nent.</p>
    
    <p>It’s a good oppor&shy;tu&shy;nity also to sub&shy;tly insult the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son&shy;™’s intel&shy;li&shy;gence, by sug&shy;gest&shy;ing they sim&shy;ply aren’t edu&shy;cat&shy;ed, or well edu&shy;cated enough, to really be par&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pat&shy;ing in these con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tions.</p>
    
    <p>How&shy;ever should the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ sud&shy;denly reveal that they are well-&shy;versed in acad&shy;emia, or other Mar&shy;ginalised Peo&shy;ple™ who are join in, or if the whole thing began on an aca&shy;d&shy;emic foot&shy;ing, you can swiftly take the other tack and dress them down for being “too intel&shy;lec&shy;tu&shy;al”. Remem&shy;ber, Mar&shy;ginalised Peo&shy;ple™ who con&shy;form to the stan&shy;dard per&shy;cep&shy;tion of “in&shy;tel&shy;lec&shy;tu&shy;al” are get&shy;ting above them&shy;selves and so deserve noth&shy;ing but your deri&shy;sion.</p>
    
    <p>You can talk about how they are alien&shy;at&shy;ing peo&shy;ple, speak&shy;ing above them and behav&shy;ing in a very con&shy;de&shy;scend&shy;ing man&shy;ner. You really want to think about your lan&shy;guage here, to truly com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;cate just how much dis&shy;dain you have for their edu&shy;ca&shy;tion/&shy;man&shy;ner. “Up&shy;pi&shy;ty” is a par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;larly bristling word to Peo&shy;ple of Colour, par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;larly African-Amer&shy;i&shy;cans, as they have rou&shy;tinely been called “up&shy;pi&shy;ty” when they have been “get&shy;ting out of place”. “Hoity-&shy;toity”, “high&shy;hand&shy;ed” and “snob&shy;bish” are also excel&shy;lent words. It sug&shy;gests that the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ is enter&shy;tain&shy;ing lofty notions of them&shy;self that are unde&shy;served when all they are doing is com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;cat&shy;ing in the man&shy;ner you would insist on had they not. We all have places in life and the pre&shy;ferred place for Mar&shy;ginalised Peo&shy;ple™ is under your shoe.</p>
    
    <p>The impor&shy;tant thing is to really drive home that you con&shy;sider their intel&shy;li&shy;gence and edu&shy;ca&shy;tion – whether for&shy;mal or self&shy;-&shy;gained – to be sub&shy;par and that they are demean&shy;ing/os&shy;tracis&shy;ing oth&shy;ers by util&shy;is&shy;ing it. You want them to feel ashamed of it, or at the least reminded that Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Peo&shy;ple® think they have no rights to it.</p>
    
    <p>It’s a really good idea to get a friend involved in this one – one of you can take the path of “in&shy;tel&shy;lec&shy;tu&shy;al&shy;is&shy;m”, whilst the other can be deri&shy;sive of the same. This is espe&shy;cially use&shy;ful if more than one Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ is involved in the con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion. Keep bat&shy;ter&shy;ing at them from all sides and things will swiftly dete&shy;ri&shy;o&shy;rate.</p>
    
    <p>It’s also really awe&shy;some to utilise the tac&shy;tic of cor&shy;rect&shy;ing gram&shy;mar and/or spelling mis&shy;takes and crit&shy;i&shy;cis&shy;ing com&shy;ments on form rather than con&shy;tent to fur&shy;ther dis&shy;tract from the issues. You want peo&shy;ple for whom the lan&shy;guage being used is sec&shy;ond, third or fourth, or peo&shy;ple with less for&shy;mal edu&shy;ca&shy;tion to really be aware of their short&shy;com&shy;ings and you want oth&shy;ers for whom it is a first lan&shy;guage and who have for&shy;mal edu&shy;ca&shy;tion to feel chas&shy;tised by their mis&shy;takes (even though in heated con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tions and gen&shy;eral inter&shy;net dis&shy;course such mis&shy;takes are com&shy;mon and not reflec&shy;tive at all of some&shy;one’s capac&shy;i&shy;ty). This tac&shy;tic cov&shy;ers ALL angles in this regard and is sure to incur feel&shy;ings of shame and dimin&shy;ish&shy;ment.</p>
    <h1 id='youre-interrogating-from-the-wrong-perspective'>You're Interrogating From The Wrong Perspective</h1><p>This is a very spe&shy;cial tac&shy;tic but that does&shy;n’t mean it should&shy;n’t be freely or lib&shy;er&shy;ally used. If any&shy;thing, it means you should use it as often and as widely as you can.</p>
    
    <p>You see, in this one you get to insult their intel&shy;li&shy;gence and per&shy;cep&shy;tive&shy;ness but in a very sub&shy;tle and under&shy;handed way! This one is very use&shy;ful in dis&shy;cus&shy;sions about lit&shy;er&shy;a&shy;ture and other media or acad&shy;emia.</p>
    
    <p>The gist of it is this: there’s noth&shy;ing offen&shy;sive in there,<strong>you just don’t get it</strong>(be&shy;cause you are too stupid)!</p>
    
    <p>For exam&shy;ple – you might want to impress your belief that con&shy;text is irrel&shy;e&shy;vant (there’s no racist par&shy;al&shy;lels in a mytho&shy;log&shy;i&shy;cal planet where beau&shy;ti&shy;ful white elves keep hor&shy;ri&shy;ble, ani&shy;mal&shy;is&shy;tic orcs as slaves – it’s com&shy;pletely detached from earth’s his&shy;to&shy;ry!), or that they’re just read&shy;ing it wrong (well sure, you could take that atti&shy;tude if you approach it from that per&shy;spec&shy;tive, but that’s not the per&shy;spec&shy;tive it was meant to be read with so your argu&shy;ment is just flawed!).</p>
    
    <p>Once again (and truly a fun&shy;da&shy;men&shy;tal aspect of derail&shy;ing) you demon&shy;strate your lack of aware&shy;ness of their issues but you also get to tell them that they’re wrong because you (and all the other Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Peo&shy;ple®) sim&shy;ply know bet&shy;ter. Try it out and just wait and see what you get back.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Burn, baby, burn!</strong></p>
    <h1 id='youre-arguing-with-opinions-not-fact'>You're Arguing With Opinions Not Fact</h1><p>If you really want to excel as a Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Per&shy;son® you need to learn to value data, sta&shy;tis&shy;tics, research stud&shy;ies and empir&shy;i&shy;cal evi&shy;dence above all things, but espe&shy;cially above Lived Expe&shy;ri&shy;ence©.</p>
    
    <p>You can pre&shy;tend you are obliv&shy;i&shy;ous to the fact most stud&shy;ies have been car&shy;ried out by Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Peo&shy;ple® and there&shy;fore carry inher&shy;ent bias&shy;es, and insist that the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ pro&shy;duce “Ev&shy;i&shy;dence” of what they‘re claim&shy;ing.</p>
    
    <p>Their Lived Expe&shy;ri&shy;ence© does not count as evi&shy;dence, for it is sub&shy;jec&shy;tive and there&shy;fore worth&shy;less.</p>
    
    <p>This is very impor&shy;tant because it works in two ways: 1) it com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;cates to the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ that their per&shy;sonal tes&shy;ta&shy;ment is dis&shy;be&shy;lieved and of no val&shy;ue, caus&shy;ing them great hurt; and 2) it once again rein&shy;forces your priv&shy;i&shy;lege.</p>
    
    <p>You see, the very capac&shy;ity to con&shy;duct stud&shy;ies, col&shy;lect data and write detached “fac&shy;t-based” reports on it, is an inher&shy;ently priv&shy;i&shy;leged activ&shy;i&shy;ty. The abil&shy;ity to widely access this mate&shy;r&shy;ial and research it exhaus&shy;tively is also inher&shy;ently priv&shy;i&shy;leged. Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Peo&shy;ple® find it eas&shy;ier to pur&shy;sue these avenues than Mar&shy;ginalised Peo&shy;ple™ and so once again you are remind&shy;ing them you pos&shy;sess this priv&shy;i&shy;lege and rein&shy;forc&shy;ing that the world at large val&shy;ues a sys&shy;tem of analy&shy;sis that excludes them, and val&shy;ues it over what their actual per&shy;sonal expe&shy;ri&shy;ence has been.</p>
    
    <p>The process of valu&shy;ing “fact” over “opin&shy;ion” is one very much rooted in pre&shy;serv&shy;ing priv&shy;i&shy;lege. Through this method&shy;ol&shy;o&shy;gy, the con&shy;tin&shy;ued pain and oth&shy;er&shy;ing of mil&shy;lions of peo&shy;ple can be ignored because it’s sup&shy;ported by “opin&shy;ion” (emo&shy;tion) and not “fact” (ra&shy;tional&shy;i&shy;ty).</p>
    
    <p>It is also impor&shy;tant because it calls on the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ to do some&shy;thing that is sim&shy;ply impos&shy;si&shy;ble, and that is sum&shy;mate the entirety of their group’s expe&shy;ri&shy;ences into a defin&shy;i&shy;tive exam&shy;ple. It is impor&shy;tant that you estab&shy;lish this prece&shy;dent for the next cou&shy;ple of steps.</p>
    <h1 id='your-experience-is-not-representative-of-everyone'>Your Experience Is Not Representative Of Everyone</h1><p>Of course, straw man argu&shy;ments are crit&shy;i&shy;cal to any suc&shy;cess&shy;ful derail&shy;ing of con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion. It’s very impor&shy;tant to dis&shy;count the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son&shy;’s™ expe&shy;ri&shy;ence at every avail&shy;able oppor&shy;tu&shy;ni&shy;ty. Apart from being sim&shy;ply out&shy;right hurt&shy;ful and demean&shy;ing, it also forces them into a con&shy;stant posi&shy;tion of defence.</p>
    
    <p>If a Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ gives you a per&shy;sonal tes&shy;ta&shy;ment, then you must imme&shy;di&shy;ately assume they are speak&shy;ing on behalf of their entire group of peo&shy;ple and be very quick to point out that it’s wrong for them to do so.</p>
    
    <p>It’s a diver&shy;sion&shy;ary tac&shy;tic, designed to get them deny&shy;ing your accu&shy;sa&shy;tion and so for&shy;get&shy;ting to con&shy;tinue to argue their point.</p>
    
    <p>You will find that some&shy;thing very impor&shy;tant to Mar&shy;ginalised Peo&shy;ple™ is stress&shy;ing the fact that they are not all the same. This is because Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Peo&shy;ple® have rou&shy;tinely lumped them all together as one great big mono&shy;lithic group who all look the same, act the same, think the same, speak the same, dress the same, eat the same, feel the same – you get the idea. And, of course, all of those mono&shy;lithic behav&shy;iours are “other” than those of the Priv&shy;i&shy;leged®. Oth&shy;er&shy;ing is a process that per&shy;mits Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Peo&shy;ple® to con&shy;sider the Mar&shy;ginalised™ as less than human, thereby jus&shy;ti&shy;fy&shy;ing dis&shy;crim&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tive and stig&shy;ma&shy;tis&shy;ing behav&shy;iours against them. So nat&shy;u&shy;ral&shy;ly, it is imper&shy;a&shy;tive to a Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ to make it under&shy;stood their group of peo&shy;ple are as diverse in expres&shy;sion and expe&shy;ri&shy;ence as Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Peo&shy;ple®.</p>
    
    <p>You can play on this con&shy;cern by alarm&shy;ing and insult&shy;ing them with the impli&shy;ca&shy;tion you think they are homogenis&shy;ing their own group.</p>
    
    <p>It also works to sug&shy;gest to them that their expe&shy;ri&shy;ence is worth&shy;less because it does&shy;n’t align with every&shy;one’s – par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;larly those that you’ve decided to favour. That is, the expe&shy;ri&shy;ences that, to your mind, back up your prej&shy;u&shy;dices. This is belit&shy;tling and offen&shy;sive in the extreme as you are essen&shy;tially deny&shy;ing their real&shy;i&shy;ty. Peo&shy;ple’s per&shy;sonal expe&shy;ri&shy;ences are impor&shy;tant to them, so it’s likely they will, whilst get&shy;ting increas&shy;ingly hurt and upset, con&shy;tinue to try and defend and “prove” them to your exact&shy;ing mea&shy;sures while you can bask in the sat&shy;is&shy;fac&shy;tion of know&shy;ing you have caused them dis&shy;tress.</p>
    
    <p><strong>You are well on your way to win&shy;ning!</strong></p>
    <h1 id='unless-you-can-prove-your-experience-is-widespread-i-wont-believe-it'>Unless You Can Prove Your Experience Is Widespread I Won't Believe It</h1><p>You’ve suc&shy;cess&shy;fully got them in a catch-22: we’ve already estab&shy;lished expe&shy;ri&shy;ence is not a mono&shy;lith and just because peo&shy;ple come from the same Mar&shy;ginalised Group™ does not mean they will all have the same thoughts and feel&shy;ings and expe&shy;ri&shy;ences.</p>
    
    <p>Yet with this one you can make it an essen&shy;tial pro&shy;viso of your agree&shy;ment that they have to PROVE what they’re claim&shy;ing is defin&shy;i&shy;tively rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tive of a major&shy;ity of their group of peo&shy;ple.</p>
    
    <p>What is really awe&shy;some is that if, by this point, you have them so upset and frus&shy;trated that they are not care&shy;fully dis&shy;claim&shy;ing their lan&shy;guage and so say some&shy;thing that you can in any way dis&shy;tort to mean that they‘re speak&shy;ing “on behalf“ of all peo&shy;ple from their group, you can go right back up to the prior point,<a href="#your-experience-is-not-representative-of-everyone">Your Expe&shy;ri&shy;ence Is Not Rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tive of Every&shy;one</a>, and start all over again. You can repeat these two as many times as you like! In fact, this is highly rec&shy;om&shy;mended as it will increase feel&shy;ings of anger and frus&shy;tra&shy;tion on their part, and then you can throw<a href="#youre-taking-things-too-personally">You’re Tak&shy;ing Things Too Per&shy;son&shy;ally</a>or<a href="#youre-being-hostile">You’re Get&shy;ting Hos&shy;tile</a>at them!</p>
    <h1 id='i-dont-think-youre-as-marginalised-as-you-claim'>I Don't Think You're As Marginalised As You Claim</h1><p>This tac&shy;tic is related to<a href="#">Your Expe&shy;ri&shy;ence Is Not Rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tive Of Every&shy;one</a>but is a far more hurt&shy;ful and there&shy;fore effec&shy;tive weapon.</p>
    
    <p>If the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ is gain&shy;ing steam in the con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion, begin&shy;ning to per&shy;suade oth&shy;ers to their point of view, even get&shy;ting a few Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Peo&shy;ple® around you to apol&shy;o&shy;gise and con&shy;cede their “mis&shy;takes”, then is when you drop this bomb: call into ques&shy;tion their Mar&shy;ginalised™ sta&shy;tus.</p>
    
    <p>It allows you to once more dimin&shy;ish their expe&shy;ri&shy;ence by dis&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ing it, as well as rein&shy;forces that “other&shy;ing” we’ve already dis&shy;cussed.</p>
    
    <p>If you’re in a sit&shy;u&shy;a&shy;tion with a per&shy;son from a non-Eng&shy;lish speak&shy;ing coun&shy;try who speaks, reads and writes in fluid Eng&shy;lish (par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;larly if so much so you assumed at first they were native Eng&shy;lish speak&shy;ers) you must insist this means they received a spe&shy;cial sort of edu&shy;ca&shy;tion (prob&shy;a&shy;bly in an Eng&shy;lish-s&shy;peak&shy;ing coun&shy;try) that is denied to their coun&shy;try folk and this means they’re sim&shy;ply not qual&shy;i&shy;fied to talk about life in their home coun&shy;try – they’re too Priv&shy;i&shy;leged® to really under&shy;stand.</p>
    
    <p>Or if you’re talk&shy;ing to a Per&shy;son with Dis&shy;abil&shy;i&shy;ties, you must deri&shy;sively claim they can’t be all “that” dis&shy;abled because, if they were, they sim&shy;ply would&shy;n’t be able to com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;cate so well with you. Or, you know, think at all.</p>
    
    <p>It’s great to whip this one out on sex work&shy;ers too – if a sex worker is mak&shy;ing the claim that sex work can be a pos&shy;i&shy;tive and empow&shy;er&shy;ing choice or the issue isn‘t the work but the stigma lev&shy;elled at it, you absolutely must say they are obvi&shy;ously a very Priv&shy;i&shy;leged® sex worker because “re&shy;al” sex work&shy;ers are always degrad&shy;ed, hate their jobs and are forced into it.</p>
    
    <p>The really impor&shy;tant thing is to estab&shy;lish some sort of false Mar&shy;ginal&shy;i&shy;sa&shy;tion Hier&shy;ar&shy;chy™ where the per&shy;son you’re speak&shy;ing to could&shy;n’t<em>pos&shy;si&shy;bly expe&shy;ri&shy;ence any&shy;where near</em>the sort of stigma and dis&shy;crim&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion every&shy;one else from their group does. This way you can force them to pro&shy;vide “ev&shy;i&shy;dence” of what they’ve dealt with which you can just dis&shy;re&shy;gard and fur&shy;ther dis&shy;miss as more “proof” they are actu&shy;ally really Priv&shy;i&shy;leged® exam&shy;ples and there&shy;fore have no right at all to be speak&shy;ing.</p>
    
    <p>Do be sure you strike a care&shy;ful bal&shy;ance though – whilst you must make it clear you con&shy;sider this Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ to be Priv&shy;i&shy;leged® you must be sure you nonethe&shy;less indi&shy;cate they still are Less Than You, so be as dis&shy;dain&shy;ful and con&shy;temp&shy;tu&shy;ous as pos&shy;si&shy;ble.</p>
    
    <p>This step is just out&shy;right sleazy, which is what makes it so fan&shy;tas&shy;tic to use: it will have an effect rather like a punch to the gut on the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™, caus&shy;ing them to sharply inhale as they reel from your sheer arro&shy;gance and cru&shy;el&shy;ty. Deny&shy;ing their Lived Expe&shy;ri&shy;ence© must never be under&shy;es&shy;ti&shy;mated as a strat&shy;egy – remem&shy;ber: being dehu&shy;man&shy;ised is exhaust&shy;ing and this will increase your capac&shy;ity to win!</p>
    <h1 id='arent-you-treating-each-other-worse-anyway'>Aren't You Treating Each Other Worse Anyway</h1><p>This one is great – it’s the Derail&shy;ing for Dum&shy;mies below the belt suck&shy;er-punch! By using this one you at once dis&shy;tract from the topic at hand at the same time as con&shy;firm&shy;ing just the sort of big&shy;otry you real&shy;ly, truly believe (like they did&shy;n’t already know!). Addi&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ly, it demon&shy;strates the height of your Priv&shy;i&shy;lege® – that you are so dis&shy;tanced from real&shy;ity you are inca&shy;pable of per&shy;ceiv&shy;ing how mar&shy;ginal&shy;i&shy;sa&shy;tion, objec&shy;ti&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tion and social ostraci&shy;sa&shy;tion may have con&shy;tributed to inter&shy;nal issues as the Mar&shy;ginalised Group™ strug&shy;gle to get by in a world that treats them like prop&shy;erty or abber&shy;a&shy;tions.</p>
    
    <p>When the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ is talk&shy;ing about the sort of dis&shy;crim&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion they face from Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Peo&shy;ple® and it’s begin&shy;ning to make you feel a lit&shy;tle uncom&shy;fort&shy;able, it’s a great oppor&shy;tu&shy;nity to trot out, say, stats about “black&shy;-on-black” vio&shy;lence to dis&shy;miss police bru&shy;tal&shy;i&shy;ty, or per&shy;haps talk about how women are all really mean and bitchy and crit&shy;i&shy;cise each oth&shy;er’s body to indi&shy;cate that soci&shy;etal pres&shy;sure on weight and body image is irrel&shy;e&shy;vant.</p>
    
    <p>You could even talk about gay men and their wild, unpro&shy;tected sex orgies being entirely respon&shy;si&shy;ble for the spread of AIDS to dimin&shy;ish gay bash&shy;ing and homo&shy;pho&shy;bia (after all, if a good, straight male has to fear catch&shy;ing the AIDS from a gay man strolling past, beat&shy;ing him to a pulp with a fire hydrant is totally rea&shy;son&shy;able!).</p>
    
    <p>But best of all, it sug&shy;gests that they are entirely respon&shy;si&shy;ble for all the trial and tribu&shy;la&shy;tion that they face – it’s not dis&shy;crim&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tive soci&shy;ety, no way, no how! It’s their inca&shy;pac&shy;ity to treat each other respect&shy;ful&shy;ly. Because they’re, you know, less than human. Only the most degraded and depraved would be so rot&shy;ten to their own kind! Right?</p>
    
    <p>As the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ steadily realises this is your atti&shy;tude, they will be over&shy;whelmed with hor&shy;ror and, with any luck, they will lose track of their argu&shy;ment – or maybe just grind to a halt, enabling you to sit back smugly and rack up another point to your score.</p>
    <h1 id='but-youre-different-to-the-others'>But You're Different To The Others</h1><p>Back&shy;handed insults are a fan&shy;tas&shy;tic way to trip up and flum&shy;mox a Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™. This step is often used when you’ve said some&shy;thing dis&shy;crim&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tory either for&shy;get&shy;ting or being obliv&shy;i&shy;ous to the fact a per&shy;son from the Mar&shy;ginalised Group™ you’re tar&shy;get&shy;ing is right there and has seen/&shy;heard it.</p>
    
    <p>They will be offended of course, and that’s when you try to mol&shy;lify them by reas&shy;sur&shy;ing them that they’re “dif&shy;fer&shy;ent” to the oth&shy;ers.</p>
    
    <p>“Oh, you’re not like all those<em>other</em>bitchy wom&shy;en” per&shy;haps, or may&shy;be: “Yes, but you’re an<em>attrac&shy;tive</em>fat man!”</p>
    
    <p>Other sug&shy;ges&shy;tions include: “I was&shy;n’t talk&shy;ing about you when I was say&shy;ing most trans women are ugly. You pass pretty well!”; “Yes, but you’re not like those other black peo&shy;ple who won’t bet&shy;ter them&shy;selves, you’re very edu&shy;cat&shy;ed!”. Maybe even: “It’s so good that you stay away from drugs, unlike those other sex work&shy;er&shy;s”.</p>
    
    <p>Per&shy;haps even: “Sure, but most men&shy;tally ill peo&shy;ple are very self&shy;ish and self&shy;-ob&shy;sessed. You’re a really<em>nice</em>per&shy;son!”</p>
    
    <p>Not only do you get to rein&shy;force com&shy;monly held stereo&shy;types about var&shy;i&shy;ous Mar&shy;ginalised Groups™ reveal&shy;ing that you truly believe them, you get to deliver a dou&shy;ble-edged com&shy;pli&shy;ment to the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ involved. By using this tac&shy;tic you’re hop&shy;ing to play on their emo&shy;tions, con&shy;nect with their usual expe&shy;ri&shy;ence of being Mar&shy;ginalised™ for being “other” and turn it around by now “flat&shy;ter&shy;ing” them for it and how they are dif&shy;fer&shy;en&shy;ti&shy;ated from the “others” because they’re “spe&shy;cial” and (al&shy;most) wor&shy;thy of a place in the ranks of the Priv&shy;i&shy;leged® (al&shy;most) because they are bet&shy;ter at con&shy;form&shy;ing to stan&shy;dards set by the Priv&shy;i&shy;leged®.</p>
    
    <p>So deeply ingrained can many insult&shy;ing pre&shy;con&shy;cep&shy;tions of their Mar&shy;ginalised Group™ be that they may be tor&shy;tur&shy;ously flat&shy;tered – we all like to feel the sun on our faces after all! And so, in this way, you also get to rein&shy;force the inter&shy;nalised stigma they may car&shy;ry.</p>
    
    <p>Final&shy;ly, you will invoke rage on behalf of their fel&shy;lows whom you have sweep&shy;ingly and sum&shy;mar&shy;ily dis&shy;missed and degrad&shy;ed. A con&shy;flict&shy;ing swirl of emo&shy;tions is very use&shy;ful to work with!</p>
    
    <p>And final&shy;ly, of course, you once again imply it is your right as a Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Per&shy;son® to pass judge&shy;ment or cast approval of them.</p>
    
    <p>How&shy;ever be warned if you’re using this tac&shy;tic to try and halt the con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion before it goes any fur&shy;ther: the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ may very well be fur&shy;ther pro&shy;voked into con&shy;fronting you with your igno&shy;rance. Use it with cau&shy;tion.</p>
    <h1 id='well-i-know-another-person-from-your-group-who-disagrees'>Well I Know Another Person From Your Group Who Disagrees!</h1><p>This one is fan&shy;tas&shy;tic to bring out if you feel at all backed into a cor&shy;ner. If, for exam&shy;ple, the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ is mak&shy;ing sense and you’re begin&shy;ning to get the unpleas&shy;ant feel&shy;ing that you were wrong about some&shy;thing, just whip up your friend – your black friend, or your trans friend, your friend with a men&shy;tal ill&shy;ness, or your friend who is a sex work&shy;er, and vehe&shy;mently express how they com&shy;pletely and stri&shy;dently sup&shy;port your opin&shy;ions on these issues.</p>
    
    <p>Of course, you must make out as though you are entirely obliv&shy;i&shy;ous to inter&shy;nalised stigma and how your friends may have been adversely affected by dis&shy;crim&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion wielded by the Priv&shy;i&shy;leged®. And, as estab&shy;lished by the steps above, it is imper&shy;a&shy;tive that you dis&shy;count the diver&shy;sity of expe&shy;ri&shy;ence whilst seem&shy;ing to sup&shy;port it. After all, your friend is proof that there are dif&shy;fer&shy;ent opin&shy;ions amongst this Mar&shy;ginalised Group™ but the fact they agree with you means you don’t have to in the least give cre&shy;dence to ideas alter&shy;na&shy;tive to your own, and cer&shy;tainly not from the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ in ques&shy;tion.</p>
    
    <p>Plus it gives you that handy pro&shy;gres&shy;sive veneer – see, all their accu&shy;sa&shy;tions of racis&shy;m/&shy;sex&shy;is&shy;m/ableis&shy;m/what have you are totally ground&shy;less because you have friends who are rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tives from that group which shows how open-&shy;minded and awe&shy;somely cool you really are!</p>
    
    <p>You know what the best part about this step is?</p>
    
    <p><em>The friend does&shy;n’t even have to exist!</em></p>
    
    <p>That’s right, the friend can be noth&shy;ing more than a fig&shy;ment of your imag&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion, con&shy;jured up to pro&shy;vide you with vicar&shy;i&shy;ous backup in your hour of need! How is the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ going to prove it, after all! They can have their sus&shy;pi&shy;cions but that’s hardly hard evi&shy;dence.</p>
    
    <p><strong>You’re def&shy;i&shy;nitely ahead in the game now!</strong></p>
    <h1 id='a-in-b-situation-is-not-equivalent-to-x-in-y-situation'>A in B Situation Is Not Equivalent To X in Y Situation</h1><p>Your Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ may put in a last-ditch effort to be patient and rea&shy;son&shy;able by using an anal&shy;o&shy;gy. If you are your&shy;self a mem&shy;ber of a Mar&shy;ginalised Com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ty™ exer&shy;cis&shy;ing priv&shy;i&shy;lege over the group you’re argu&shy;ing with, the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ may use an exam&shy;ple of dis&shy;crim&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion towards your com&shy;mu&shy;nity and how there are par&shy;al&shy;lels in dis&shy;crim&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion towards theirs. This will be to try and appeal to your basic human&shy;ity and pro&shy;vide you with an expe&shy;ri&shy;ence you can relate to, hop&shy;ing you will use that rela&shy;tion to apply com&shy;pas&shy;sion.</p>
    
    <p>Don’t wor&shy;ry! You can still get out of this one!</p>
    
    <p>Sim&shy;ply become indig&shy;nant and be very sure to empha&shy;sise that your expe&shy;ri&shy;ence is absolutely and one hun&shy;dred per cent unique and there are no sim&shy;i&shy;lar&shy;i&shy;ties what&shy;so&shy;ever between the two sit&shy;u&shy;a&shy;tions. Be sure that you are very deri&shy;sive of their expe&shy;ri&shy;ence, thereby indi&shy;cat&shy;ing you believe it unwor&shy;thy of con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tion. You must also behave insult&shy;ed, so as to indi&shy;cate their issues are so worth&shy;less that it’s deeply offen&shy;sive your own would be com&shy;pared to them!</p>
    
    <p>Of course, the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ was not try&shy;ing to equate the two, sim&shy;ply try&shy;ing to pro&shy;vide grounds for com&shy;mon&shy;al&shy;i&shy;ty. It’s very impor&shy;tant not to give an inch, how&shy;ev&shy;er, so feign utter igno&shy;rance of this at all costs.</p>
    
    <p>Remem&shy;ber: you want them to feel they really are less than human. It weak&shy;ens their posi&shy;tion and that’s impor&shy;tant if you want to win.</p>
    <h1 id='who-wins-gold-in-the-oppression-olympics'>Who Wins Gold in the Oppression Olympics?</h1><p>Fol&shy;low&shy;ing on from this, if you are a mem&shy;ber of another Mar&shy;ginalised Group™, you can also exploit it to indi&shy;cate to the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ how absolutely dis&shy;dain&shy;ful you are of their con&shy;cerns and issues by mak&shy;ing out that yours are far more impor&shy;tant and imper&shy;a&shy;tive.</p>
    
    <p>You can even sug&shy;gest that your issues are more valu&shy;able than theirs, imply&shy;ing a hier&shy;ar&shy;chy of oppres&shy;sion in which you always win.</p>
    
    <p>You see, as a Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son ™ your&shy;self, it is all the more infu&shy;ri&shy;at&shy;ing to another Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ that you’re exer&shy;cis&shy;ing the exact same prej&shy;u&shy;dices and dis&shy;crim&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion that Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Peo&shy;ple® exer&shy;cise against you! The Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ will be tear&shy;ing their hair out at your obliv&shy;i&shy;ous&shy;ness and lack of per&shy;cep&shy;tion and this will weaken their defences.</p>
    <h1 id='you-have-a-false-consciousness'>You Have A False Consciousness</h1><p>In con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion, there are few things as degrad&shy;ing, enrag&shy;ing and hurt&shy;ful than to tell some&shy;one their expe&shy;ri&shy;ences are false, or that their per&shy;cep&shy;tion of them is.</p>
    
    <p>The idea behind this one is usu&shy;ally that oppressed peo&shy;ple are sim&shy;ply too oppressed to know they’re oppressed and there&shy;fore Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Peo&shy;ple® have to share their wis&shy;dom and insight with them.</p>
    
    <p>This one crops up a lot in issues that affect wom&shy;en: women who enjoy dress&shy;ing in con&shy;ven&shy;tion&shy;ally fem&shy;i&shy;nine ways (they’re engrained in the patri&shy;ar&shy;chal con&shy;struct of fem&shy;i&shy;nin&shy;ity and there&shy;fore are inca&shy;pable of mak&shy;ing a choice), women who are kinky, regard&shy;less of the gen&shy;der of the per&shy;son they play with (they’re engrained in the patri&shy;ar&shy;chal con&shy;struct of gen&shy;der roles and there&shy;fore are inca&shy;pable of mak&shy;ing a choice) and sex work&shy;ers who claim to enjoy their work and/or prac&shy;tice it with auton&shy;omy (they’re engrained in the patri&shy;ar&shy;chal con&shy;struct of female sex&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ity and there&shy;fore are inca&shy;pable of mak&shy;ing a choice).</p>
    
    <p>But this also affects Peo&shy;ple with Dis&shy;abil&shy;i&shy;ties who are rou&shy;tinely told they sim&shy;ply don’t under&shy;stand what is best for them and need a Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Per&shy;son® to make deci&shy;sions for them. Peo&shy;ple with Dis&shy;abil&shy;i&shy;ties are not able to make any deci&shy;sions for their own pro&shy;tec&shy;tion. Remem&shy;ber to stress that:<em>it’s for your own pro&shy;tec&shy;tion</em>.</p>
    
    <p>With the trans com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ty, you must rou&shy;tinely deny their gen&shy;der iden&shy;tity by equat&shy;ing their expe&shy;ri&shy;ences as hav&shy;ing hap&shy;pened to some&shy;one of the gen&shy;der they were des&shy;ig&shy;nated at birth. For exam&shy;ple, deny&shy;ing the real&shy;ity of gen&shy;der dys&shy;mor&shy;phia means you can tell a trans woman her child&shy;hood expe&shy;ri&shy;ences hap&shy;pened to a lit&shy;tle boy, because that’s how she was being raised, and so com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;cate your belief her real&shy;ity as a lit&shy;tle girl was false, thor&shy;oughly under&shy;min&shy;ing it.</p>
    
    <p>In argu&shy;ments about race, it takes a slightly dif&shy;fer&shy;ent form, gen&shy;er&shy;ally in white peo&shy;ple telling Peo&shy;ple of Colour that they’re “see&shy;ing race where none exist&shy;s”. You, on the other hand, are “colour blind” and we live in “post-ra&shy;cial” times. It’s them who are mak&shy;ing every&shy;thing about race and their expe&shy;ri&shy;ence of racism in their daily lives is sim&shy;ply imag&shy;ined. If only they could let it go, the whole world would live in post-ra&shy;cial har&shy;mony!</p>
    
    <p>You really want to ignore any claims the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ may make about hav&shy;ing done thor&shy;ough research, decon&shy;struct&shy;ing and unpack&shy;ing of these issues. You also really want to deny their auton&shy;o&shy;my. There are few things so infu&shy;ri&shy;at&shy;ing as infan&shy;til&shy;is&shy;ing an adult and telling them they’re delu&shy;sional about their own real&shy;i&shy;ty. But they need to under&shy;stand that, no mat&shy;ter what,<em>you</em>know bet&shy;ter.</p>
    <h1 id='youre-not-being-a-team-player'>You're Not Being A Team Player</h1><p>Shift&shy;ing blame is very impor&shy;tant in these mat&shy;ters. You don’t ever want to have to own up to any respon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;ity for hurt or dis&shy;tress caused and you most def&shy;i&shy;nitely do not want to admit your prej&shy;u&shy;dice or big&shy;otry. You also want that Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ to be con&shy;tin&shy;u&shy;ously aware just how “on the fringes” they are, and always will be (pro&shy;vid&shy;ing you get your way – but that’s what Priv&shy;i&shy;lege® is for, after all!).</p>
    
    <p>You can achieve both these things by accus&shy;ing the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ of not play&shy;ing fair, or of not play&shy;ing with “the team” (i.e.: you and all the other Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Peo&shy;ple® back&shy;ing you up).</p>
    
    <p>“C’&shy;mon”, you say, “we’re all doing our best to par&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pate in a rea&shy;son&shy;able, impar&shy;tial debate. You aren’t join&shy;ing in. You’re try&shy;ing to turn this into a fight. You’re ruin&shy;ing it for every&shy;one else!”</p>
    
    <p>In other words:<em>if you just did and said exactly every&shy;thing we Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Peo&shy;ple® demand of you, life would be so much eas&shy;ier. For me. For you, well, what gave you the impres&shy;sion I care about you?</em></p>
    
    <p>This tac&shy;tic sub&shy;tly com&shy;bines sev&shy;eral of the above points:<a href="#">You’re Tak&shy;ing Things Too Per&shy;son&shy;ally</a>,<a href="#">You’re Argu&shy;ing With Opin&shy;ions, Not Fact</a>and<a href="#">You Have A False Con&shy;scious&shy;ness</a>, and really makes the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ feel ganged up on.</p>
    
    <p>It’s great to gang-up on some&shy;one, par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;larly some&shy;one who faces such oth&shy;er&shy;ing every day of their lives. It rein&shy;forces their sense of iso&shy;la&shy;tion, which will dis&shy;tress and dis&shy;ori&shy;ent them, weak&shy;en&shy;ing their stance.</p>
    
    <p>Deliver it in just the right con&shy;de&shy;scend&shy;ing tone too, and you will really unhinge them…</p>
    <h1 id='youve-lost-your-temper-so-i-dont-have-to-listen-to-you-anymore'>You've Lost Your Temper So I Don't Have To Listen To You Anymore</h1><p>This one is par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;larly effec&shy;tive because it really pushes home a sense of futil&shy;ity and hope&shy;less&shy;ness to the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™. Remem&shy;ber they should never get the impres&shy;sion they can win one of these argu&shy;ments, because you should be con&shy;sis&shy;tently imply&shy;ing that there was never any&shy;thing to argue over to begin with.</p>
    
    <p>If you’ve been fol&shy;low&shy;ing the steps cor&shy;rectly so far, by this point any rea&shy;son&shy;able per&shy;son is going to be feel&shy;ing pretty angry. This anger could lead to them being more aggres&shy;sive and abra&shy;sive. The Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ has pos&shy;si&shy;bly even decided that you’re sim&shy;ply too obnox&shy;ious to waste patience on and is vent&shy;ing their sense of frus&shy;tra&shy;tion.</p>
    
    <p>This is when you whip this step out!</p>
    
    <p>You can use it to dis&shy;re&shy;gard every&shy;thing they’ve said to you and just not deal with the issue, in par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar ignor&shy;ing your prior behav&shy;iour that led to the anger. Con&shy;ven&shy;tions of social con&shy;duct hold civil dis&shy;course as the ideal at all times. When peo&shy;ple get angry, it gives you a con&shy;ve&shy;nient “out” with&shy;out hav&shy;ing to con&shy;cede to any of their objec&shy;tions or acknowl&shy;edge their pain.</p>
    
    <p>Fur&shy;ther&shy;more, with this one you can make it seem as though you were ready and will&shy;ing to lis&shy;ten, but then they ruined it. This way you can leave them with the sense that if only they’d been a good lit&shy;tle Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ and toed the line, then they may have won some&shy;one over to the cause!</p>
    
    <p>It just adds a par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar dis&shy;taste to the whole affair that no derail&shy;ing should be with&shy;out!</p>
    <h1 id='you-are-damaging-your-cause-by-being-angry'>You Are Damaging Your Cause By Being Angry</h1><p>By now their feel&shy;ings are prob&shy;a&shy;bly deeply hurt and they’re very angry. Don’t for&shy;get they encounter this kind of dis&shy;crim&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion in sub&shy;tle ways every sin&shy;gle day of their life, so they’re bound to be emo&shy;tional about it, even resent&shy;ful.</p>
    
    <p><em>You can take advan&shy;tage of this weak&shy;ness</em>to emerge the vic&shy;tor! After all, every&shy;one knows the Mar&shy;ginalised™ have an oblig&shy;a&shy;tion to con&shy;duct them&shy;selves with quiet dig&shy;nity in the face of infu&shy;ri&shy;at&shy;ing tribu&shy;la&shy;tion and if your quarry begins to get angry and “ag&shy;gres&shy;sive” then you have won! Why? Well, it’s very sim&shy;ple – just hold them as rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tive of their entire group! You could try say&shy;ing some&shy;thing like “you realise you’re mak&shy;ing all X look bad?”, or “well, con&shy;grat&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tions for back&shy;ing up the stereo&shy;type of X as being angry, irra&shy;tional and over&shy;sen&shy;si&shy;tive!” Maybe you can even say “well, I was about to say I was will&shy;ing to lis&shy;ten to you, but then you got insult&shy;ing so now I don’t have to!”</p>
    
    <p>Don’t worry about silly things like their feel&shy;ings – c’mon, they’re grownups, aren’t they! The only thing that mat&shy;ters is defend&shy;ing your dis&shy;crim&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion as com&shy;pletely fair and to avoid exam&shy;in&shy;ing your prej&shy;u&shy;diced argu&shy;ments in ways that may chal&shy;lenge them. You could even drop this lit&shy;tle bomb: “You are dam&shy;ag&shy;ing your cause by being angry, real under&shy;stand&shy;ing can only hap&shy;pen if all sides are respect&shy;ful and patien&shy;t”.</p>
    
    <p>Not only do you come across as a smug, self&shy;-righteous ass&shy;hat (though you may pre&shy;fer the term “big&shy;ger per&shy;son”) you can also man&shy;age to sub&shy;tly make them feel guilty about their anger, as though it’s unde&shy;served! Every&shy;body wins! Well, except them of course.</p>
    <h1 id='youre-as-bad-as-they-are'>You're As Bad As They Are!</h1><p>Def&shy;i&shy;nitely one of the last tac&shy;tics you should bring out if you’re find&shy;ing that the Mar&shy;ginalised Per&shy;son™ is sim&shy;ply relent&shy;less and you are run&shy;ning out of options.</p>
    
    <p>This one is an out&shy;right insult. By now they have prob&shy;a&shy;bly ripped all your prej&shy;u&shy;dices apart and harshly crit&shy;i&shy;cised both your atti&shy;tudes and the Priv&shy;i&shy;leged® sys&shy;tem you reside with&shy;in. You are prob&shy;a&shy;bly tak&shy;ing it very per&shy;son&shy;ally because it’s shak&shy;ing the foun&shy;da&shy;tions of your beliefs and mak&shy;ing you con&shy;front aspects of your own behav&shy;iour and nature that you would rather not.</p>
    
    <p>That’s when you say to them:<em>you are just as bad as the peo&shy;ple who oppress you!</em></p>
    
    <p>Because they’re angry about the treat&shy;ment they undergo and because they are aggres&shy;sive and per&shy;sis&shy;tent in want&shy;ing to see change hap&shy;pen, you can tar&shy;get this behav&shy;iour (re&shy;mem&shy;ber&shy;ing that it is unseemly for Mar&shy;ginalised Peo&shy;ple™ – they’re sup&shy;posed to set an exam&shy;ple at all times by being hum&shy;ble and long suf&shy;fer&shy;ing) by sug&shy;gest&shy;ing it puts them on a par with the peo&shy;ple and sys&shy;tem that stig&shy;ma&shy;tise, ostracise and tar&shy;get them every sec&shy;ond of every day of their lives. This also sug&shy;gests that react&shy;ing to such dis&shy;crim&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion is totally unrea&shy;son&shy;able and out of pro&shy;por&shy;tion (they should just take their knock&shy;s!) and that has the ben&shy;e&shy;fit of indi&shy;cat&shy;ing your igno&shy;rance to just how per&shy;va&shy;sive and con&shy;stant this dis&shy;crim&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion truly is.</p>
    
    <p>This one is impor&shy;tant if you really want to demon&shy;strate what a scum&shy;bag you are so do be care&shy;ful to whip it out at pre&shy;cisely the right moment. Used cor&shy;rectly and it can be some&shy;thing of a slam&shy;dunk!</p>
    <h1 id='surprise-i-was-playing-devils-advocate-all-along'>Surprise! I Was Playing "Devil's Advocate" All Along!</h1><p>It can hap&shy;pen: you may reach the point where, in spite of expertly using all of these tac&shy;tics, you’re sud&shy;denly struck by the dis&shy;com&shy;fort&shy;ing notion that maybe the Mar&shy;ginalised Peo&shy;ple™, uh,<em>have a point</em>.</p>
    
    <p>This does&shy;n’t feel very good for any Priv&shy;i&shy;leged Per&shy;son®. It’s highly uncom&shy;fort&shy;able for a start-off, the sen&shy;sa&shy;tion<em>you may be wrong about some&shy;thing</em>. But even worse, it may mean you have to endure the humil&shy;i&shy;a&shy;tion of<em>admit&shy;ting that</em>!!</p>
    
    <p>But never fear, for all is not lost! You can still worm your way out of this one!</p>
    
    <p>Sim&shy;ply say:</p>
    
    <p><strong><em>“It was all a social exper&shy;i&shy;men&shy;t!”</em></strong></p>
    
    <p>This makes it okay, you see! Not only does it imply to the Mar&shy;ginalised Peo&shy;ple™ you’re really not the igno&shy;rant, obnox&shy;ious bigot you might be begin&shy;ning to realise you are, you suc&shy;cess&shy;fully com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;cate to them that you are<em>that</em>insen&shy;si&shy;tive,<em>that</em>arro&shy;gant and<em>that</em>much of a douchebag you would take very real and seri&shy;ous issues that affect their lives and treat them as noth&shy;ing more than a the&shy;o&shy;ret&shy;i&shy;cal dis&shy;cus&shy;sion for your own detached amuse&shy;ment!</p>
    
    <p>In this way you cover your arse whilst affirm&shy;ing your priv&shy;i&shy;lege!</p>
